1. Write a program to sum all the values of a given Array in Java.
2. What is the output? Answer: it doesn't compile due to syntax errors. Other answer, **it prints the index of the largest value in the arrray (2).** 

          double[ ] exampleArray = {1,5,6,5,4,1};

          double maximum = examplesArray[0];

          int index = 0;

          for (int i = 1; i<exampleArray.length>; i++){

               if (exampleArray[ i ] > maximum) {

                    maximum = exampleArray[ i ];

                    index = i;

               }

          }

          System.out.println(index);

3. Write a public static method called "toPower" that takes in as parameters two integers called size and power. The method should return an array of size "size" with each array index raised to the value of "power." So, for example, if we passed in "size = 4" and "power = 2" to the "toPower," the method should return the following result: [0,1,4,9].
